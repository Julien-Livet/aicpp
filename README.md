**aicpp** is a deterministic symbolic program synthesis engine written in C++, guided by structural reductions generated by large language models (LLMs).

Instead of using LLMs to generate final solutions, aicpp uses them to **reduce the structural search space**, while a native compiled symbolic engine performs bounded-depth exhaustive search.

The goal is to explore a hybrid architecture that balances:

- Determinism  
- Explicability  
- Structural compositionality  
- Native performance  
- Controlled LLM guidance

## 🧠 Core Idea

LLMs are powerful pattern recognizers.

However, instead of letting them directly generate solutions, we use them to:

1. Select relevant primitives  
2. Generate partial structural parameterizations  
3. Reduce combinatorial explosion  

Then a deterministic C++ engine:

- Composes typed primitives
- Explores bounded search depth
- Orders by cost
- Returns explicit symbolic solutions

LLM = structural prior  
C++ engine = deterministic solver

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using Docker

```bash
ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
git clone https://github.com/Julien-Livet/aicpp.git
cd aicpp
git clone https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-2.git
docker build -t aicpp .
docker run --rm aicpp
cd scripts
python engine.py
```

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The system consists of:
1. Primitives (C++)
    - Typed transformation functions
2. Neuron
    - Wraps a primitive function
    - Defines input/output types
3. Connection
    - Composed graph of neurons
    - Brain
    - Manages search space
    - Performs cost-ordered exploration
    - Serializes discovered structures
4. LLM Pipeline (Python)
    - Analyzes ARC task examples
    - Selects relevant primitives
    - Generates structural partials
    - Triggers dynamic compilation
    - Launches exploration

## 🧪 Example (ARC Flip Task)

Given ARC input-output examples, the LLM selects only:
- `flipud`
- `fliplr`

The engine then deterministically explores combinations and returns a symbolic solution such as:
`flipud(fliplr(input))`

No stochastic reasoning occurs in the solving phase.

## 📊 Why This Approach?

Traditional approaches:
- Deep learning → latent, non-explicit
- Program synthesis → combinatorial explosion
- LLM direct generation → non-deterministic

aicpp explores:
    LLM-guided structural reduction + deterministic symbolic completion

This separation preserves:
- Reproducibility
- Inspectability
- Controlled search

## 🔬 Research Perspective

aicpp is an experimental research framework exploring:
- Structural partial parameterization
- Deterministic symbolic completion
- Hybrid symbolic–LLM architectures
- Combinatorial reduction strategies

It is not a production ARC solver.

## 🧠 Vision

aicpp investigates a fundamental hypothesis:
    Large language models are most effective when used as structural reducers,
    not as direct reasoning engines.

The long-term goal is to build scalable, deterministic, and explicable hybrid reasoning systems.
